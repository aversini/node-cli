const encrypted = encrypt("password", "Hello World");
```

### Decrypt a string with a password

```

### Hash a password with a default salt

import { hashPassword } from "@node-cli/secret";
const hashed = hashPassword("password");
// hashed === "some-default-salt:some-hex-string
```

### Hash a password with a custom salt

```js
import { createSalt, hashPassword } from "@node-cli/secret";
const salt = createSalt(42);
const hashed = hashPassword("password", salt);
// hashed === "some-salt:some-hex-string
```

### Verify a password against a hash

import { hashPassword, verifyPassword } from "@node-cli/secret";
const hashed = hashPassword("password");
const isVerified = verifyPassword("password", hashed);
