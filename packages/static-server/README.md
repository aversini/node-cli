# Static Server

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@node-cli/static-server?label=version&logo=npm)

> Static Server is a simple, zero-configuration, command line HTTP server to serve static files locally.

## Installation

This command line utility can be installed globally or locally within your project. It does make more sense to have it installed globally though, since it then can be use anywhere by simply starting it to serve the files located in the current folder.

```sh
> npm install -g @node-cli/static-server
```

## Usage

```sh
> static-server [options] [path]
```

`[path]` defaults to the current folder if it's not provided at the command line prompt.

At that point, you should be able to visit `http://localhost:8080` and see the files located in the current folder.
